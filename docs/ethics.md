## Ethical Concerns with AI Art

Artists may have concerns about:

- Lack of intentionality and authenticity in AI-generated art.
- Potential replacement of human artists and impact on livelihoods.

## Where We Stand on Humans, AI, and Art

We envision a collaborative future where:

- Humans and AI work together to create innovative art.
- New movements and mediums emerge from AI-human collaboration.
- AI acts as an augmentation tool rather than a replacement.
